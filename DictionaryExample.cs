/*
    A Dictionary is a dynamic data structure which represents a collection of key/value pairs 
    that are organized based on the hash code of the key. They are very good for storing unsorted data.

    The Dictionary data structure is similar to the Hashtable and also uses key/value pairs, however it is a 
    generic data type; whereas the hashtable is not. 
    This means the Dictionary provides type safety because you can't insert any random object into it 
    and you don't have to cast values that are taken out.

    Because dictionaries are unordered, they are generally not ideal for lists of values like 
    strings and numbers --- although this example uses this.

    The key is likened to a unique identifier - a primary key in a data base table
    Database developers use primary keys to uniquely identify each row in the table - much like using
    Drivers License numbers, Tax file numbers, Bank account numbers, Passport numbers etc.
    In this example, each unique element has an atomic number (e.g. Oxygen's atomic number is 8 and no other
    element has this atomic number).

    https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xfhwa508(v=vs.110).aspx

    This example includes an example of using File IO to read an external plaintext file (.csv format)
    which consists of a list of 118 elements (with atomic number, element name and element symbol)
    This external file (named "elements.csv" needs to be in the same directory as the executable)

    This example is structured in a simple 4-step process:

    1. Declare data variables needed for this program
    2. Get/Set input for the data we need
    3. Process the data in some meaningful way
    4. Output what we want to see

    The understanding is based on the idea that every computer program runs this way despite its complexity

    Source code is error-free and was tested in MS Visual Studio 2015 as at March, 2017
